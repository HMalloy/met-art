# met-art SEO learnings
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) should be organic and natural to your site's intent and content. There are ways to help it along, but these should not mislead users or make it more difficult to use your website. There are individuals who are experts in SEO and whole jobs and companies devoted to improving SEO. There is no expectation that a front-end developer is going to be "the" expert in this area, but having some knowledge of how the structure, metadata, and content for your website can support better SEO will give you a leg up in a couple of ways:
1. The way that you implement your website will be better suited to good SEO practices
2. It will be easier for you to communicate with those experts and marketing individuals about SEO practices

There are many tools available to help you identify appropriate keywords for your website. There are also many tools available to help ensure that the structure of your site supports a good user experience. For instance Google analytics provides tools that show you how users move through your site, what links they are clicking on, and what pages they spend the most time on. There are also heatmapping tools that will show you where users spend the most of their time focusing on a page and provides a bit more the "why" than just analytics alone. This will help you consider where to place certain content on your page.

## met-art SEO implementation
Ideally, based on what we have learned about SEO, here are some ways I would consider SEO more intentionally for this website:
1. Ensure that H1 tags on each page have short, meaningful content that clearly aligns with what is on the page.
2. Ensure that headings h1-h6 are being used in the proper order on the pages.
3. Utilize the resource links provided within the met art API to provide meaningful cross-links to other websites and resources.
4. Provide helpful guidelines for Authors to write SEO friendly blog posts.
5. Using Moz's free keyword search tool, here are some good keywords that could be incorporated:
  a. art museum
  b. the art museum
